Cleaned data used by the code locate at Dumbo HDFS:
/user/yz3768/rent

Code Description:

train_feature.scala:
- extract features from training data, see the comment in the code for more details
- need input data at rent/train
- save facility_list at rent/facility_list 
- save some maps of features at rent/manager_code, rent/manager_score, rent/building_score
- save KMeansModel at rent/KMeansModel for neighborhood clustering for test data 
- output training data in "libsvm" format at rent/train_data

test_feature.scala:
- generate features from testing data
- need input data at rent/test
- need facility_list, manager_code, manager_score, building_score, KMeansModel
- output testing data in "libsvm" format at rent/test_data

classifier.scala:
- train a classifier using random forest
- need training data 
- save trained model at rent/RFmodel

predict.scala
- need testing data
- need model
- output prediction at rent/prediction

Run the whole process using the following commands:
//training
spark-shell -i train_feature.scala
spark-shell -i classifier.scala
//testing
spark-shell -i test_feature.scala
spark-shell -i predict.scala

or one command: 

spark-shell -i train_feature.scala test_feature.scala classifier.scala predict.scala
